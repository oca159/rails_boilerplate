## References
### Bootstrap generators

You can learn more about my own implementation of this gem in [bootstrap-generators](https://github.com/oca159/bootstrap-generators).

Basically, I just changed the index template for erb and haml engines to work with the jquery-datatables and I modified desing.

### Jquery Datatables

You can learn more about this gem in [bootstrap-generators](https://github.com/oca159/jquery-datatables-rails).

This is not my implementation, I only did fork to the main repository.

## To do

* Integrate devise gem. (I am thinking about this because not all projects use this gem)
